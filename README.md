**Taking React from frontend to full-stack with GraphQL and Apollo**

## What is this book about?
React and GraphQL combined would provide a very dynamic, efficient, and stable tech stack to build web-based applications. GraphQL is a modern solution for querying an API which represents an alternative to REST and is the next evolution in web development.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Build a GraphQL API by implementing models and schemas with Apollo and Sequelize
* Set up an Apollo Client and build front end components using React
* Write Reusable React Components and use React Hooks
* Authenticate and query user data using GraphQL
* Use Mocha to write test cases for your full-stack application
* Deploy your application to AWS using Docker and CircleCIrs
